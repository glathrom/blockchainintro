# Blockchain Introduction

This project is based on the write-up given by Dave Nash which can be found [here](https://davenash.com/2017/10/build-a-blockchain-with-c/).
In fact, the only structural differences in this project and Dave's project is my use of the openssl library for the computation of the `sha256` hashes.
